### **Task Objective**
  Predict heart disease presence using patient health attributes
### **Dataset used**
  Heart Disease UCI dataset (From Kaggle)
  Features include: age, sex, cp, chol, thal, trestbps, thalch, slope, exang, oldpeak, ca  
  Target: num
### **Model Applied**
  Logistic Regression
  Decision Tree
### **Key Results and findings**
    Logistic Regression accuracy: **~56%**
    Decision Tree accuracy: **~50%**
    ROC-AUC score for Logistic Regression: **0.81**
    Important features: chol, age, thalch, oldpeak, trestbps, cp types
    Model captures risk patterns but multi-class prediction is challenging.
